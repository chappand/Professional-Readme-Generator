## Installation

You just need to make sure that you do "npm install" to get the correct packages installed. Once that is done, you will be able to run the program by typing "node index.js" into the terminal.

## Usage

Just navigate to the correct folder in your terminal and type "node index.js" to start the program. Answer the questions as the populate. I have added a video tutorial here: [Tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l4WvcsQLw0F9l7ERFgLCxcEEMayMZvdR/view)

## Contributing

There will be no contributions to this particular Repository

## Tests

The only way to test is to run the program. Once you have run it and either gotten an error or generated a readme, you can run the program again to make any changes needed.
